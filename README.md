# Usage
HTML encode QStrings.  You can use it like so: HtmlEncodedString("mywackyunencodedinput"), or like so: HtmlEncodedString::encodeString("mywackyunencodedinput").

That's really about all there is to it.

# How to install

qthtmlencodedstring is available via qt-pods. See here for reference:
https://github.com/cybercatalyst/qt-pods

Alternatively, you can just copy the files into your source tree.  They don't have any dependencies beyond Qt Core.
